# Pip's Obsidian Tools

This is a collection of tools I use to operate on my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault. It's probably not useful to
anyone else, but maybe I'm wrong. If this stuff helps you in any way, let me know. I'm happy to hear about it.

## How to use

Configure the path to your Obsidian vault in `.env` or `.env.local`:

```
VAULT_PATH="/path/to/my vault"
```

Run the tools

```bash
./run
```
